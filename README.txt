Purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my digital logic design skill using VHDL and FPGA


This repository contains my VHDL assignments as part of my Embedded Systems Development program (Digital Design Principles-EECE8000).
These assignments are developed on Altera quartus-II 13.0 software and executed on Altera DE-I board (Cyclone-II FPGA).

VHDL files are as follows:

1] basic_gates.vhd : Implementation of basic logic gates AND, OR, XOR, XNOR, NAND, NOR.

2] shift_register.vhd : Implementation of universal shift register.

3] counter.vhd : Implementation counter logic.

4] BCD_conv.vhd : Implementation of Binary to BCD convertor.

5] magnitude_comparator.vhd : Implementation of magnitude comparator logic.

6] state_machine.vhd : Implementation of cross-walk scenario to understand working state machine.

7] combination_lock_project.vhd : Implementation of combination lock using state machine concept (Note : unlocking key pattern is fixed according to way it programmed).
